# apt-update-Hash-sum-mismatch-workaround
# Do not use this in production environment! 

This is workaround for broken apt update (Hash sum mismatch) in debian-based systems like Kali linux, Ubuntu etc.
I have no idea why this bug happens on Oracle VM.

This script runs apt-update and changes expected hashes with recived so you can use apt.
